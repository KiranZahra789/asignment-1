1. Messages
   In the context of AI models, messages refer to the sequence of inputs (questions, commands, or prompts) and outputs (responses) exchanged between the user and the model. This history helps maintain context during a conversation.

2. Model
   The model is the AI system responsible for generating responses. Models like GPT (e.g., GPT-4) are trained on large datasets to understand and produce human-like text.

3. Max Completion Tokens
   Max Completion Tokens define the maximum length of the model's output in terms of tokens. A token is a unit of text, typically a word or part of a word. For example, setting Max Completion Tokens to 100 limits the modelâ€™s response to approximately 100 tokens.

4. n
   This parameter specifies the number of responses generated by the model for a single input. For example, if n=3, the model will generate three different responses for the given prompt.

5. Stream
   The stream parameter enables real-time, incremental output of the model's response, delivering text as it's generated rather than waiting for the full response to complete.

6. Temperature
   The temperature controls the randomness of the model's output:

Lower values (e.g., 0.2) make responses more focused and deterministic.
Higher values (e.g., 0.8) introduce more randomness and creativity in responses. 7. Top_p
Also known as nucleus sampling, this parameter limits the model's response to the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds a specified value (e.g., top_p=0.9). It is an alternative to temperature for controlling randomness.

8. Tools
   Tools are additional functionalities integrated with the AI model, like web browsing, code execution, or image generation. These enhance the model's capabilities by allowing it to retrieve real-time information, perform calculations, or generate creative content.
